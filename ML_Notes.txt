Preprocessing in ML:

Preprocesing --> 
Filling in the missing values.
Encoding the dataset: Eg --> In the iris dataset, encoding various species into numbers.
Feature Scaling: StandardScaler , MinMaxScaler.

Removing unnecessary stopwords from data.

K-Fold Cross validation --> For evaluating the true accuracy score of the model.
GridCV --> For finding the best combination of hyper-parameters for the model.

Stratified Splitting --> Used to split various target classes in same number.

Vectorizing --> Converting string data to unique vectors for the ML model to train upon.

Building a pipeline.
